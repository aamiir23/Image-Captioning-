# Image-Captioning

The Image Captioning project, available on GitHub, leverages deep learning techniques to automatically generate captions for images. It combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to extract visual features from images and generate contextually relevant descriptions. The model is trained on large datasets to predict a sequence of words that describe the content of the given image. This project demonstrates the integration of computer vision and natural language processing to create an AI system capable of interpreting images and providing descriptive text. The implementation is based on popular frameworks like TensorFlow and Keras, ensuring efficient model training and deployment.
